# PDF Generator Improvements

## Overview of Changes

The PDF generator module has been completely restructured to be more maintainable, readable, and object-oriented. Here's a summary of the improvements:

### 1. Class-Based Design

- Created a `LyricsPDFGenerator` class to encapsulate PDF generation logic
- This allows better organization and reuse of the PDF generation code
- Maintained a simple function interface for backward compatibility

### 2. Improved Code Organization

- Separated functionality into focused methods with clear responsibility
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved parameter passing between methods

### 3. Better Documentation

- Added comprehensive docstrings to all methods
- Included explanatory comments for complex operations
- Used proper type hints throughout

### 4. Simplified Logic

- Removed unnecessary nested functions
- Streamlined font size optimization logic
- Eliminated redundant checks and operations

### 5. Clearer Variable Names

- Used more descriptive variable names
- Maintained consistent naming conventions

### 6. Added Configuration Options

- Made margins, font sizes, and paths configurable via constructor
- This allows for greater flexibility when creating PDFs

### 7. Cleaner Error Handling

- Added better status reporting
- Improved file cleanup for temporary files

## Key Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: The code is now easier to maintain and extend
2. **Flexibility**: Font properties and page settings can be easily configured
3. **Readability**: The code flow is clearer and more intuitive 
4. **Reusability**: The class can be instantiated with different settings for different uses

## Usage Example

```python
# Simple usage with default settings (backward compatible)
create_pdf("Lyrics content here", "output.pdf")

# Advanced usage with custom settings
generator = LyricsPDFGenerator(
    margins=5,
    min_font_size=8,
    font_name='Arial',
    font_path="Arial.ttf"
)
generator.create_pdf("Lyrics content here", "custom_output.pdf")
```
